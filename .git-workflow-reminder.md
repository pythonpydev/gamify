# Multi-Machine Git Workflow

## BEFORE starting work on ANY machine:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

## AFTER finishing work on ANY machine:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main
```

## If you get "divergent branches" error:
```bash
# Option 1: If you haven't made local changes yet
git reset --hard origin/main

# Option 2: If you have local changes to keep
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop
# Then resolve any conflicts and commit
```

## Best Practice:
- ALWAYS pull before starting work
- ALWAYS push after committing
- Don't let OneDrive sync .git folder conflicts
